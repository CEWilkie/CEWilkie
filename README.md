# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Thanks For Visiting My Profile!

I am very dedicated to my work, and below I have pinned my current best
repositories that represent my skills. Over on the linked
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MisterPuggsProgramming), I also 
upload short clips demonstrating my projects in action.

### My Current Projects
Currently, I am working on a Voxel Game using C++ and OpenGL. I have also been
spending my time learning Java in order to branch out my skills.

### My Interests
- I love playing chess, be it solving puzzles or against others. In 
    [this repository](https://github.com/CEWilkie/Chess-with-SDL) I started to
    create my own chess program using the Stockfish API as a chess bot!
- I also love cats! This isn't related to any projects, just a personal fact.
